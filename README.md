Create a hello world workflow
1. create a new repo called CI-CD with just a readme
2. head over to the actions tab and browse some of the available workflows
3. choose to create a new workflow yourself, you should be shown a simple workflow template
4. step through this line by line, explaining what it does refer to the documentation if you need and answer the following questions
* are the square brackes needed within the on necessary?
* github runs workflows by looking for them in a specific location. Where is that?
* what are the names of the pre-built actions are used in this template? What do they do?
5. commit the workflow yes, from within github not at all great practice to be editing code within github rather than your IDE, but fine for now
6. push to the main branch trigger after editing a file check the actions tab in the github repo
